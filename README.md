>I do not Intend to pursue this project any further once the website is done i am most likely to not open a seller account on Fiverr, post anything on YouTube or Instagram, as it is not at all the point of the project and would take to much time.

>Due to a thunderstorm corrupting most of my computer's files last September, I had lost all of my Minecraft creations, and could only use builds from my private realm which were not that impressive

> As such, some of the builds used as illustration on the website were not my creations, and all credits may be found [Credits](#credits).
